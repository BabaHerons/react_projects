# React Learning Projects

This repository contains small React projects I am building while learning React.  
Each folder is an independent project with its own setup.

## Projects

- **todo_simple**  
  A basic to-do app with add/remove functionality.

- **todo_login**  
  A to-do app with simple login/authentication flow.

(More projects will be added as I learn new concepts.)

## Getting Started

To run any project:

1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd project_name
